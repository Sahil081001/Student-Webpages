# Sahil Dayal's Developer Portfolio

Hi there! I'm **Sahil Dayal**, a junior in high school currently enrolled in AP Computer Science Essentials and Principles. I'm passionate about technology and programming, and I created this portfolio to showcase some of the projects I've worked on during the course.

## 📚 What I Learned

Throughout this class, I learned valuable programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and how to apply creativity in coding. Each project taught me something different—from working with time and intervals in JavaScript, to basic game logic and user interaction, and even UI styling with CSS.

## 🌐 About This Portfolio Site

This portfolio is a simple and modern website that uses HTML and CSS to showcase my featured projects. The design is responsive and includes hover effects, shadows, and a consistent color scheme to make the experience visually engaging.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ⏰ [The Digital Clock](https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/bNdNPwW)
My first independent project! This digital clock uses JavaScript to update in real-time. It helped me understand how to work with `setInterval`, time objects, and DOM manipulation.

### 🏓 [Double Ball Pong](https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/RNPNzKr)
This one was a fun challenge—a twist on the classic Pong game, but with two balls! I learned about canvas-based animations, collision detection, and game logic.

### 🎨 [The Color Switcher](https://codepen.io/SahilD111/pen/RNwBjBV)
A simpler but visually fun project. It switches the background color when you click a button. Great for learning how to work with event listeners and CSS classes dynamically.
